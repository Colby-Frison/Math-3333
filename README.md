## General Outline

You can use this section to provide a high-level summary of the course, your study approach, or any other information you want to highlight.

### How to Use This Repository
- Please don't just copy or steal my work or the solutions provided. This will only benefit if used as a reference; while taking notes, solving problems, or annotating the textbook I tried my best to explain it in the most detail possible so I can understand it in the future, so I hope you appreciate the detail.

### Additional Notes
- There are a lot of good free textbooks online if you ever need more reference material, but the one provided here is pretty good and has a lot of good examples and problems.
- The channel 3Blue1Brown also has a pretty good series on linear algebra, I recommend checking it out if you want to learn more about the concepts. It does go in a completely different order than this course though, so it may only be good as a pro- or retroactive measure, instead of supplementary material.
